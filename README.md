# BushTripInjector

BetaBushTripInjector generates fully functional bush trips from LittleNavMap flight plans. Missing texts are automatically added meaningfully. No search for coordinates or heights for the runway or waypoints. They are there.
Briefing images as well as images of the runways for the NavLog are of course generated. These are real graphics and not images with text only.
It's all GUI controlled and you don't have to worry about formatting. No XML or programming skills required.
QuickStartGuide is included.
Despite intensive testing, bugs and problems may occur. If you have an issue, please PM me at

# Installation

Open the zip-file with the tool of your choice. Drag the BushTripInjector folder (containing the EXE file and the DLL) to a place of your choice. Please note that since several files are created, both Flightsimulator and BushTripInjector have rights to create, modify and delete files and folders in thefolder of your choice. So it must not be directly in the program directories ("Program Files" or "Program Files (x86)")
