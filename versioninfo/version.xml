1.2.5.2804 - File system restructure (Part I)&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; *Project Root Folder:*&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added the feature to select the root folder where BushTripInjector stores your projects (%PROJECT_ROOT%). By default, it remains to &lt;i&gt;%BTI_HOME%\PackageSource&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;When selecting a new folder, you will be asked if you want to copy, move or do nothing with your previous folder.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Learn more about the file system structure of BTI: &lt;a href="https://www.bushtripinjector.de/manual/filesystem/"&gt;BushTripInjector Manual Filesystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; *Log Files:* &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added the possibility to select the log file folder, LogLevel, retention time and rolling mode on options screen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Moved the default log file folder from &lt;i&gt;%BTI_HOME%&lt;/i&gt; to a sub folder &lt;i&gt;%BTI_HOME%\Logs&lt;/i&gt;. Existing log files will be moved automatically.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Log files will be removed automatically after a retention time. Default is 31 days&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; *Libraries:*&lt;br&gt;Moved the referenced and included DLLs of the package to a subfolder &lt;i&gt;Lib&lt;/i&gt;. BTI try to delete the old DLLs automatically.&lt;br&gt;Maybe your security software blocks BushTripInjector from deleting those libraries and you get some warnings or issues starting BTI. Please delete all DLL from &lt;i&gt;%BTI_HOME%&lt;/i&gt; by yourself.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt; *INI file:*&lt;br&gt;Migrated several project related entries of the INI file to BTI Fileformat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
 *This Version has many changes in the core functionallity of BushTripInjector. Despite intensive testing, bugs and problems may occur. If you have an issue, please contact me on Discord: &lt;a href="http://discord.bushtripinjector.de/"&gt;discord.bushtripinjector.de&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thank you very much.*&#xD;
UPDATE: *Options:* Renamed the &lt;i&gt;Sim Settings&lt;/i&gt; Tab to &lt;i&gt;Options&lt;/i&gt; and moved it to the end.&#xD;
UPDATE: *DiscoveryFlights:* Fixed an issue preventing BTI to generate a DiscoveryFlight&#xD;
BUGFIX: *Sound files:* Fixed an issue with the migration of sound files to the new folder: Some files were detected as unused and moved/copied to orphaned.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *Startup:* Fixed an issue with writing exception file on startup&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
1.2.4.2755&#xD;
USER-REQ: *Flight book:* The folder for saving the flight book has been changed to %MissionFolder%\AdditionalFiles\Documents (before: %BTIHOME%\Documents). No migration of already created flight books.&#xD;

1.2.3.2743&#xD;
HIGHLIGHT: Sound files &#xD;
FEATURE: The sound files work again for all legs after leaving the mission or trip.&lt;br&gt; _IMPORTANT:_ Your current files will be moved to &lt;i&gt;%MissionHome%\AdditionalFiles\Sound\&amp;ltBaseLanguageCode&amp;gt&lt;/i&gt;. Please backup your sound folder before opening your mission.&lt;br&gt;Migrated missions will not work with older versions of BushTripInjector with sound files until you remap those files in the older version.&#xD;
FEATURE: *Localized Sound files:* Use different sound files for each language for text-to-speech or InstructorDialogAction. Copy the wav-file into &lt;i&gt;%MissionHome%\AdditionalFiles\Sound\&amp;ltLanguageCode&amp;gt&lt;/i&gt; with the same filename. You will find more information at &lt;a href="https://www.bushtripinjector.de/manual/localized-soundfiles/"&gt;BushTripInjector Manual - Localized Sound Files&lt;/a&gt; &#xD;

&#xD;
---&#xD;
1.2.1.2700&#xD;
HIGHLIGHT: Partial Missions&#xD;
PRO-VERSION: *Marketplace:* Removing whitespaces from image filenames for marketplace for SU9. If you are currently using images with blanks in the filenames, you need to remove and add them again!&#xD;
PRO-VERSION: *Marketplace:* Support for new Marketplace.json instead of business.json will follow. &#xD;
FEATURE: *Partial Missions:* Generate your legs as single bush trips for testing purposes. Keep in mind, such a cropped bush trip may behave differently if on previous legs payload/fuel or similar were changed.&#xD;
UPDATE: *Aircraft-Selection:* Added Beechcraft D17S Staggerwing (pgilbr)&#xD;
UPDATE: *Spb-Viewer:* Updated the property definitions to sim version 1.25.7.0&#xD;

---&#xD;
1.2.0.2667&#xD;
HIGHLIGHT: World Map Improvements&#xD;
FEATURE: *WorldMap:* Create text-to-speech with information from Wikipedia directly from WorldMap.&#xD;
FEATURE: *WorldMap:* Display the areas you created in Event&amp;Triggers on the WorldMap with pins.&#xD;
FEATURE: *WorldMap:* Display the TTS created by WorldMap on WorldMap with pins.&#xD;
FEATURE: *WorldMap:* Display the waypoints and stopover airports of your trip in WorldMap with pins.&#xD;
UPDATE: *WP-Names:* Remove leading and trailing spaces from waypoint names to avoid confusing the simulator.&#xD;
UPDATE: *TTS:* With a simupdate there was a change in the behavior of DelaySeconds for TTS. Previously the delay applied from the start of the action, now from the end of the action. This makes the automatic calculation of BushTripInjector unnecessary and it was therefore removed. Please check your TTS and the EnterDelay/ExitDelay there and reset it to a smaller value. &#xD;
BUGFIX: *BTI-File:* Fixed an issue where updating the copy of the LittleNavMap file contained in BTI did not work. This only affected if you deleted your LittleNavMap file and BTI used the internal copy. &#xD;
BUGFIX: *BTI-File:* Departure coordinates were not changed if the departure airport was changed and the new and old airport had an identically named parking position available.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *ProximityTrigger:* The reference to the ProximityTrigger has been removed from all areas when the ProximityTrigger is removed.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *Aircrafts:* The installation status of a community aircraft was not detected correctly.&#xD;
