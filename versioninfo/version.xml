More than 5700 add-ons available, daily growing.&lt;br&gt;Direkt link for each add-on to the project page on Flightsim.to&#xD;
 *Select on WorldMap-Page:* &lt;br&gt; *All* - show all add-ons (slow)&lt;br&gt; *Trip* - Show add-ons of the trip bounding box&lt;br&gt; *Leg* - Build bounding boxes for each leg and show inside add-ons&lt;br&gt; *Waypoints* - same as legs, only for Waypoints&#xD;
 *Many thanks to Flightsim.to for cooperation.*&#xD;
&#xD;
FEATURE: *Activated the AirportLandingTrigger in Events&amp;Trigger Editor!* &lt;br&gt;Already used to enable fueling on airports, it is now unlocked for use in E&amp;T. Refueling will be merged when generating a trip.&#xD;
FEATURE: *Added the OneShotSoundAction to Events&amp;Triggers Editor.* &lt;br&gt;Plays soundfiles one time for events. Because of the well known sim bug, they will not be played after you left a trip and re-join it.&#xD;
UPDATE: Fixed an issue in Event&amp;Triggers Editor that activate the triggers after load, altough user deactivated them&#xD;
UPDATE: Fixed an issue with ProximityTrigger didn't detect invalid actions in some cases.&#xD;
UPDATE: Fixed a bug detecting changes on landmarks&#xD;
UPDATE: Remove some HTML Tags in TTS, when no localisation is used.&#xD;
UPDATE: Fixed an issue that prevent triggers to be included in the Xml/Spb file when they are using CountAction, ObjectActivationAction, ResetTimerAction and/or TimerAdjustAction (Koschi)&#xD;
&#xD;

0.8.6.1246&#xD;
FEATURE: *Activated the AreaLandingTrigger in Events&amp;Trigger Editor!* &lt;br&gt;Select a cube over Landmarks, Waypoints or other coordinates as a trigger and fire any action if you land there. Use the "Paste" button to paste coordinates from Google Maps or Bing Maps.&#xD;
FEATURE: *Added the AdjustPayloadAction to Events&amp;Triggers Editor.* &lt;br&gt;This allows you to add freight or passengers on your trip. Can be nice in combination with the AreaLandingTrigger&#xD;
FEATURE: *Added the RefillAction to Events&amp;Triggers Editor.* &lt;br&gt;I have no idea how MS/Asobo calculates with percentages, but I know, it is not how I do. Just try and test it, if you have any clue, let me know, please!&#xD;
UPDATE: Removed the Business&amp;Marketplace Tab from Community Version of BushTripInjector.&#xD;
UPDATE: Fix for some GUI glitches in Events&amp;Triggers Editor&#xD;
UPDATE: Optimized detection of Refueling Airports&#xD;
UPDATE: Detection  of runway designator in flightplan improved&#xD;
&#xD;

0.8.5.1228&#xD;
FEATURE: *Activated the ProximityTrigger in Events&amp;Trigger Editor!* &lt;br&gt;Select a cube over Landmarks, Waypoints or other coordinates as a trigger and fire any action you want. Use the "Paste" button to paste coordinates from GoogleMaps or BingMaps.&lt;br&gt; *Attention:* In Combination with TTS for Waypoints, this can lead to massive FPS dropdowns. In a future version of BushTripInjector, the TTS for Waypoints will be moved to Events&amp;Triggers Editor.&#xD;
FEATURE: Added some SimVars to Conditional Editor and SimWatcher Window (Fuel and Payload)&#xD;
UPDATE: Play the TTS for Waypoints only once (as intended). Some players report multiple output every 10 sec, maybe a change with Sim 1.16.2.0, but cannot reproduce on development machine. Please report issues!&#xD;
UPDATE: Cleanup FLT File from unnecessary stuff&#xD;
UPDATE: SimWatcher Window saves position and size&#xD;
