2.1.4.4006&#xD;
 ' *NOTAM:* '&#xD;

FEATURE: *RefuelOptions:* Added a flightpath calculation to the refuel options. This is also the new default when creating new bush trips. It only covers airports that are max. 10NM away from the flight path.&#xD;
FEATURE: *LegDetection:* Optimized the leg detection. With this, the leg could be determination also when joining the flight inside of a leg and not only on leg start.&#xD;

UPDATE: *Aircrafts:* Added the *Flysimware C414AW* and *FFX Vision Jet* to payware aircraft list.&#xD;

 *Add multiple aircraft to your missions! One mission in the community folder, flyable with multiple planes.&lt;br&gt;Images and audio files are installed only once to keep the package small.&lt;br&gt;&lt;del&gt;This allows your users to fly each leg with a different aircraft of their choice or to perform other challenges and sightseeing.&lt;/del&gt; &amp;rarr; Broken by SU11*&#xD;
 *Known issues:* No different Activity-Widget. GUI needs improvement (I don't like it and will change it in a further version),&#xD;
