USER-REQ: *Wikipedia Texts from Wikipedia of your base language.* The Wikipedia texts are now determined from the base language set in BushTripInjector.

Wikipedia lives from and for everyone and can be maintained by everyone.&#xD;

UPDATE: *IngameMarker breaks bush trips:* Unfortunately, ingame markers prevent bush trips from being saved correctly in the simulator at the end of a leg and the trip cannot be continued.

(DiscoveryFlight)&#xD;
UPDATE: *Landmarks:* Show a warning message if landmarks are used in a bush trip.&#xD;
