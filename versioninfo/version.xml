1.3.3.2999 - FPS BOOST&#xD;
BushTripInjector analyzes and optimizes your triggers. This will increase the performance within the simulator by 100% or more for large missions with more than 100 triggers. For now only available for TTS selected and created in the flight plan. The implementation for TTS from the WorldMap and the E&amp;T trigger is already planned.&lt;br&gt;To enable this feature, experimental features must be enabled in the options. BTI automatically analyzes and optimizes the mission during generation. Since these are experimental features, bugs and errors may occur. *Please report working and not working missions.* &#xD;
&#xD;
FEATURE: *Debug-Mode:* When Debug Mode is enabled in Options sheet, BushTripInjector adds several TTS to FlowState, Timeline and automatically generated triggers.&#xD;
FEATURE: *Drag'n'Drop:* Drop SPB files or ZIP files containing SPB files into BTI Mainwindow to decompile the SPB and display the xml file.&#xD;
USER-REQ: *&lt;a href="https://www.bushtripinjector.de/"&gt;BushTripInjector.de&lt;/a&gt;:* Consider the system settings regarding DarkMode/LightMode of the user.&#xD;
UPDATE: *SPB-Viewer:* More modern representation of decompiled spb.&#xD;
UPDATE: *Internal:* Several optimizations and preparations for upcoming features.&#xD;
UPDATE: *SU9-BUG:* Implemented a workaround for a bug in SU9 that prevented the FlowState/TimeLine of a bush trip from being activated. This could lead to the end of the mission not being recognized correctly. To activate the Workaorund, the mission must be regenerated, regardless of whether it was created before or after SU9.&#xD;
&#xD;

1.3.2.2964 - Translation Improvements&#xD;
FEATURE: *Automatic Translation:* A feature has been added in the options to control how the automatic translation via the DeepL API should handle tags within the original language&#xD;
FEATURE: *Automatic Translation:* A feature has been added to control how the distinction and separation of sentences within the original language should be handled via translation with the DeepL API.&#xD;
FEATURE: *Automatic Translation:* A feature has been added to control how translation with the DeepL API should handle the original formatting of sentences.&#xD;
FEATURE: *Automatic Translation:* A feature has been added to control whether the translation with the DeepL API should be more or less formal than the default translation. This is available for the target languages *de-DE* (German), *fr-FR* (French), *it-IT* (Italian), *es-ES* (Spanish), *nl-NL* (Dutch), *pl-PL* (Polish), *pt-PT* and *pr-BR* (Portuguese).&#xD;
FEATURE: *Automatic Translation:* A feature has been added to control how sentences can be manually combined, separated and ignored for translation with the DeepL API in the xml handling. These tags are removed for the simulator when generating and are not part of the mission.&#xD;
FEATURE: *AdvancedMode:* The *AdvancedMode* was introduced to enable some features for experienced users. Currently, *Compile* is additionally available. You can enable this in Options.&#xD;
FEATURE: *Experimental:* In the options you can enable some experimental features in BTI, if available. No experimental features are implemented in this version.&#xD;
UPDATE: *Online-Manual:* Updated the Online manual for the new DeepL-Settings: &lt;a href="https://www.bushtripinjector.de/manual/sim-settings#deepl"&gt;BushTripInjector Manual Options - DeepL&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
UPDATE: *Options:* A few general options have been added to the GUI that were previously only available in the configuration files. For details have a look into &lt;a href="https://www.bushtripinjector.de/manual/sim-settings"&gt;BushTripInjector Manual Options - General&lt;/a&gt;. &#xD;
UPDATE: *ConfigFile:* Save the last selected path to export a model in the configuration file instead of the ini file.&#xD;
UPDATE: *TTS* Added 3 columns to Text-to-speech table: LegNo, WP-Ident and WP-Name. Those are only available for TTS generated by the flightplan and only, if BTI can re-assign them after loading.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *Adjust Elevation:* An issue was fixed on startup not to calculate elevations twice.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *Adjust Elevation:* Set the mission file to changed only if there was a change in elevations.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *Loading TTS:* Fixed an error when loading TTS to the flight plan that prevented the TTS from being correctly assigned to the waypoint. As a result, TTSs to waypoints could be created twice by the user. BTI now displays a message when loading if duplicate TTSs are found for waypoints. &#xD;
BUGFIX: *New missions:* Fixed an issue where when creating new missions, the active flightsim.to add-ons of the current mission were not cleaned up and thus used in the new mission.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *New missions:* Fixed an issue that when creating new missions, notifications were not given to the GUI when changing values in E&amp;T.&#xD;

FEATURE: *SimVars:* Moved the definitions for Simulation Variables into the Cloud. If you are missing a variable, let me know and I will add it to your BushTripInjector installation.&#xD;
UPDATE: *Event&amp;Triggers/TTS:* Added a warning message when the trip contains 10 or more areas with AltitudeIsAGL which leads to a massive FPS drop in your mission.&#xD;
UPDATE: *Compiler:* Added information message to check spaces in files and directories due to an error in MSFS/FSPackager when compilation fails.&#xD;
&#xD;
