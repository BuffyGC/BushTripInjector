  <ChangeLog>&lt;meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html;charset=UTF-8'&gt;&#xD;
&lt;h4&gt;2.0.1.3608&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
Pro-Version: *Marketplace:* Added the "zoom" and "HtmlPreview" to the description field.&#xD;
Pro-Version: *Marketplace:* Fixed an issue with the Marketplace-template. IMPORTANT: Please generate your marketplace package of 2.0.0.3564 again!&#xD;
USER-REQ: *GeneratorInfo:* Adding a "GeneratorInfo" file to the MissionRoot folder for those ladies and gentlemen who forgot where the BTI and LNM file was stored. (Thanks for the request)&#xD;
USER-REQ: *Recent-Files*: Added the possibility to remove the selected or all items from the list of recent files. (Thanks to oldmattila)&#xD;
FEATURE: *Drag and Drop:* On Flightplan-Sheet you can store several images from the file system. The assignment follows according to the rules: The file name is split into parts using " ", "-" and "_". If one of these parts contains "WPnnn" or "POInnn" the image is used as waypoint images to the corresponding waypoint. If one part contains the ICAO, another file name part must start with "BRIEF" or "LAND" and the image will be assigned to the airport as a briefing or landing image.&#xD;
FEATURE: *Bundles:* Using the GenerateInfo idea, the individual projects of the bundles can be linked to the BTI file. With this information, it is now displayed whether the individual project must be regenerated and it can be opened directly by double-clicking.&#xD;
UPDATE: *Bundles:* Added the possibility to add already compiled packages in bundles.&#xD;
UPDATE: *Database:* Updated the *main* and *parking database* to sim version 1.27.21.0&#xD;

UPDATE: *Generation:* More information about the current step is displayed during generation to avoid any confusion for the user.&#xD;
UPDATE: *Spb-Viewer:* Updated the *PropertyDefinitions* to sim version 1.27.21.0&#xD;
UPDATE: *OpenXml:* Updated the OpenXml component to the most recent version.&#xD;
UPDATE: *SimConnect:* Updated the SimConnect components to MSFS SDK 19.3.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *LandingChallenge:* Fixed an issue with starting position not updated after LNM change&#xD;
BUGFIX: *Bundles:* Fixed an issue where the bundle was not marked as changed when a project was removed.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *WorldMap:* Fixed an issue with coordinates view in release version.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *WorldMap:* Fixed an CTD with WorldMap after loading a mission.&#xD;
BUGFIX: *Misc.:* Fixed some small gui glitches for the "Misc." Sheet.&#xD;
