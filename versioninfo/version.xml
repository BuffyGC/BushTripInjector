&lt;h4&gt;2.0.3.3696 - Project Groups&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
 *Project groups help you organize your missions in separate base folders.*&lt;br&gt;Each project group has a project group directory where BushTripInjector creates and compiles the source and code files. If a project group is specified, the general %ProjectRootFolder% is ignored and the directory from the project group is used. Of course, you can add the same project group for multiple projects.&lt;br&gt;Do not open the mission in an older version of BTI, when you have selected a project group!&#xD;
&#xD;
